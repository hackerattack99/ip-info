# 🔍 IP Information Gathering Tool

---

## 🚀 Overview

IP Information Gathering Tool is a powerful and efficient script that helps you retrieve detailed information about an IP address using multiple sources. It gathers:

🔹 **Geolocation Data** – City, Region, Country  
🔹 **Hostname Lookup** – Resolves the hostname of the IP  
🔹 **WHOIS Information** – Fetches domain/IP registration details  
🔹 **DNS Records** – Retrieves associated DNS records  
🔹 **Traceroute Analysis** – Maps the route taken by packets to the IP  

---

## 🎯 Usage

Run the script **interactively**:
```bash
./ip_info_tool.sh
```

Or provide an IP address directly:
```bash
./ip_info_tool.sh 8.8.8.8
```

Example Output:
```
🔍 Gathering information for IP: 8.8.8.8
📡 Hostname: dns.google

🌍 Geolocation:
    {
      "ip": "8.8.8.8",
      "city": "Mountain View",
      "region": "California",
      "country": "US"
    }
...
```
